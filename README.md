# Image to Turtle Code

This project turns an image of any size into a turtle code. Where if you run the turtle code it will draw the image out pixel by pixel. It is pretty slow if the color have too much detail. It took a few hour to finish a 200x200 pixel image so I think I will improve it later.

# Dependency

This project uses Pillow and Numpy. If you didn't have these library you can run below command on your terminal to install it.

```
pip install numpy pillow
```

# Usage

Run the main.py program. It will asks you if you want to run Default or Manual. Default is set to the umbreon picture like below and it will make a turtle file for it with 1 pixel per block. Manual is for a custom image and pixel per block, use this to turn your own image into a turtle code.

# Afterwords

That's it basically, I did this project just for fun and I hope it is useful for someone!
